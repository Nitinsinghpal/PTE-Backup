Debate on this topic has been raging for years; 'blank' would like to see the Highland environment returned to its natural state. Opponents 'blank' the animals' 'blank' for killing livestock.",

    "Option": "A charge often leveled against organic agriculture is that it is more philosophy than science. There's some truth to this indictment, if that is what it is, though why organic farmers should feel 'blank' about it is itself a mystery, a relic, perhaps, of our fetishism of science as the only 'blank' tool with which to approach nature. The philosophy of 'blank' natural processes precedes the science of understanding them.",
